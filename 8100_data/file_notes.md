Some confusion about files and instruments. From late October download:

## Stuart folder

* TEMPESTX_SALT-202128810.81x renamed to TEMPESTX_SALT_20211015.81x based on data dates

* Has a "SALT" file: TEMPESTX_SALT_20211015.81x. We think this is correct because Stuart and Norbert switched (Stuart is now in salt)


## Kevin folder

	Has a "CONTROL" file: TEMPESTX_CONTROL_20210604.81x

	Renamed to TEMPESTX_FRESH_20210604.81x

## Norbert

* Has a "CONTROL" file: TEMPESTX_CONTROL_20210615.81x. We think this is correct because Stuart and Norbert switched (Norbert is now in control)
